# each input has their own name, each target has their own group, because we don't wanna touch it.

# if I use two feature extractors at the same time, how can I deal with it?

# or I should say that each input source should have their own name as well?

each input also has their own name and attributes




{
    'xrays':{ # this will be ralted to the name of the feature extractors
        'images'
    }
}



# how can we solve the pipelines for contrastive learning?

# make a fusor as contrastive learining extractor?
